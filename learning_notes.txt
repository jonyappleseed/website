2020-03-20 Rant
I've been trying to make FileZilla open files, specifically the htaccess file, in Atom externally. Currently, the application path I copied to FileZilla is "usr/bin/atom"; the file type association is presumably formatted correctly since several sites/comment threads had it formatted the same way (i.e. .txt /usr/bin/atom -open). For now, FileZilla is just downloading the htaccess file to my Dropbox; a little extra work in opening but I'll spend some time figuring it out over the summer.

I am going through this turmoil because I am going to use SSI (Server Side Includes) to attach my header file to all of my pages. I could very well use PHP but since I have never used it, I would rather not spend the extra time debugging; that's something I will deal with over the summer because for now I need to concentrate on getting the Cesium Tiles up.


2020-03-26 Issues
I have been able to include the navigation and header files in the index file using PHP but have run into two separate but possibly related issues.

Issue 20200326-1:
The JavaScript files connected to the navigation and header files (one per each) can no longer be accessed. When I initially tested the site, I used jQuery to connect the nav/header files to the index file but I have had no success yet in finding out where the disconnect is between the header.php & header.js (& same for nav) while using php to insert the respective php files into the index (header.php + nav.php --> index.php).

Expression:
The header will not stick to the top of the page.
The sidenav link carets will not show the pages in the menu for the user to click.

Possible solutions:
Review e-article from Smashing Magazine; I may have missed some symbols ($, parens)
Return to using jQuery
