I have been able to include the navigation and header files in the index file using PHP but have run into two separate but possibly related issues.

Issue 20200326-1:
The JavaScript files connected to the navigation and header files (one per each) can no longer be accessed. When I initially tested the site, I used jQuery to connect the nav/header files to the index file but I have had no success yet in finding out where the disconnect is between the header.php & header.js (& same for nav) while using php to insert the respective php files into the index (header.php + nav.php --> index.php).

Expression:
The header will not stick to the top of the page.
The sidenav link carets will not show the pages in the menu for the user to click.

Possible solutions:
Review e-article from Smashing Magazine; I may have missed some symbols ($, parens)
Return to using jQuery

Issue 20200326-2:
Background image will not show.

Possible solutions
Work through Issue 20200326-1 first and see if this resolves itself
Check path to image
